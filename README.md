# The repository contains:
## ATES_course : extension of TangramFP16 to FP32 
    1- The numeriacal test and validation of TangramFP32 with 1:12:11 cut configuration in C
    2- Hardware implementation of the the TangramFP32 in VHDL with calculation testing.
## Thesis : include a design and study of TangramFP based systolic array
    1- optimized design of the TangramFP with compile time reconfiguration for FP16 and FP32 with flexible cut configuration 1:p:q.
    2- First implementation of the systolic array and it integration to Zynq7000 in subfolder in systolic_array_on_Zynq7000_Minized.
    3- improved design and integrated design to Kintex-7 in subfolder  systolic_array_time_improved_on_Kintex7_Genesys2.
